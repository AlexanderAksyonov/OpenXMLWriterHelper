# OpenXMLWriterHelper
Class helper to work with the library Open XML.

At work, there was a problem with writing large amounts of data in Excel. When you create a document in 100000+ lines - the system dropped by out of memory. The solution was a data entry through OpenXmlWriter.
In this file, I have implemented a class to work with the Writer.
